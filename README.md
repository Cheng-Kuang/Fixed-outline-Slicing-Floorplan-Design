# Fixed-outline-Slicing-Floorplan-Design
In this homework, you are asked to adapt and implement an existing algorithm,
published in the DAC-86 paper entitled “A New Algorithm for Floorplan Design”
by Wong and Liu, for solving the fixed-outline slicing floorplan design problem
with a set of hard blocks.
